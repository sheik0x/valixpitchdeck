# VALIX - One Page Summary

## The Security Leasing Protocol

**Problem:** $50B+ staked across fragmented networks. Each subnet needs its own validator set, creating security islands. New subnets can't bootstrap secure validator sets (Cold Start Problem).

**Solution:** VALIX enables main chain validators to lease security to subnets without moving stake, backed by trustless economic guarantees.

---

## Three Groundbreaking Features

### 1. Atomic Cross-Chain Slashing (ACCS)
**Trustless Economic Guarantee** - Validators lock stake on main chain; cryptographically verifiable proof-of-malice triggers immediate, trustless slashing. No trusted intermediaries.

### 2. Heterogeneous Verification Module (HVM)
**Generalized Interoperability** - Standardized interface supporting EVM, Move VM, Cosmos SDK, Substrate, and custom VMs. True heterogeneous chain support.

### 3. Dynamic Fee Market
**Sustainable Economic Model** - Market where subnets bid for QoS-based security. Validators earn fees in subnet native tokens. Market-driven pricing.
